          Decreased sleep duration has been shown to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Factors such as occupation, stress level, and lifestyle are associated with sleep quality and duration. The Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset compromises 374 adults' information including their age, gender, occupation, sleep duration, sleep quality, stress level, and physical activity level. The visualization of the dataset will reveal some of the best occupations one could have if they want to secure higher quality and longer duration of sleep. The visualization also demonstrates the relationship between sleep duration and stress level, and the relationship between physical activity level and sleep quality.
